## Installation

**Requirements:** Python 3.7 or higher

**Quick Start:**
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd worklog-manager
python main.py
```

*Note: Uses Python standard library only - no external dependencies required for core functionality.*

## Usage

### Daily Workflow
1. **Start Day** - Begin time tracking for the current date
2. **Stop/Continue** - Pause for breaks (select type: Lunch, Coffee, or General) and resume work
3. **End Day** - Complete tracking and review summary (productive time, overtime, breaks)

### Key Functions

**Revoke Actions**
- Undo up to the last 5 actions with full state restoration
- Review action history before confirming rollback
- Safe validation prevents invalid state transitions

**Reset Day**
- Completely clear today's data and start fresh
- ⚠️ **Warning**: Permanently deletes all today's data - requires double confirmation

**Export Data**
- Quick export options: Today (CSV), This Week (JSON), or Custom (CSV/JSON/PDF)
- Professional reports include productivity metrics, break analysis, and statistical trends
- Automated file naming and organized export directory

### Display Reference

**Time Indicators:**
- Current Session • Total Work Time • Break Time • Productive Time • Remaining • Overtime

**Color Codes:**
- 🟢 Green: Meeting/exceeding targets
- 🟠 Orange: Approaching targets
- 🔴 Red: Overtime or critical status
- 🔵 Blue: Active session

## Technical Architecture

**Database:** SQLite with three core tables
- `work_sessions` - Daily work summaries and status
- `action_log` - Complete audit trail with timestamps
- `break_periods` - Individual break tracking by type

## Troubleshooting

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| Application won't start | Verify Python 3.7+ and file permissions |
| Database errors | Check disk space and write permissions |
| Timer not updating | Restart application or check system clock |
| Data not saving | Review logs and verify database file access |

**Debug:** Check `logs/worklog_YYYYMMDD.log` for detailed error information.
